        <p>My cat's name is Mysha. She's a Maine Coon. She is very smart, sometimes I think there is a person inside her. She hardly ever meows, just grunts. She eats special food for Maine Coons and never drinks water from the bowl, only wet her paw and lick it. She loves to play with toys and lay everywhere. She snores very funny when she sleeps. She sleeps much more than I do, which I am very jealous of. She doesn't like to be picked up, but she can come up and ask to be petted. Here are some pictures of her:</p>
